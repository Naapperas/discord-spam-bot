GENE: The world we live in.

It's so wondrous, mysterious,


 


even magical.

No. No, not that world.

I meant this one.

The smartphone.

Each system and program and app is its
own little planet of perfect technology,

all providing services so necessary,
so crucial, so unbelievably profound.

- (GASPS) Look who just sent me a text.
- Hmm?

Addie McAllister?

Must be a mistake. Or a joke.
Or a scam.

Don't send her your
Social Security number.

- Dude. Shh!
- (GRUNTS)

She's right there.


 


GENE: That's our user, Alex.

And, like every freshman
in high school,

his whole life, everything,
revolves around his phone.

(BOYS GRUNT)

(BOYS LAUGHING)
(CAMERA CLICKS)

(BUS BRAKES HISS)
(TEXT MESSAGES BEEPING)

And, as the pace of life
gets faster and faster...

- TEACHER: Phones down in five.
- (GIRL LAUGHS)

GENE: And attention spans
get shorter and shorter and...

You're probably not even
listening to me right now.

Who has the time to
type out actual words?

And that's where we come in,

the most important invention
in the history of communication...

Emojis.

That's my home.
(WHOOPING)

Textopolis.

Here, each of us
does one thing,

and we have to
nail it every time.

(LAUGHING AND WHOOPING)
The Christmas Tree just has to

stand there all festive.

Merry Christmas.

It's still September, Tim.

- GENE: The Princesses...
- Ah, I am so pretty.

GENE: They just got to wear their
crowns and keep their hair combed.

- You guys, we are so pretty.
- Oh!

Ooh! (LAUGHING)

GENE: Devil, Poop, Thumbs Up.

- They just show up, and they're good to go.
- Oh!

GENE: But for the faces,
the pressure is on.

Crier always has to cry,
even if he's just won the lottery.

Hooray! I'm a billionaire!

GENE: The Laugher is always laughing,
(LAUGHING)

even if he's just
broken his arm.

I can see the bone!
(LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)

GENE: Now, me, I'm a Meh.

So I got to be totally over it all the
time, you know, like, "Meh, who cares?"

Which is not as easy as it sounds.

Yes, well, we have
business to attend to.

- What kind of business?
- Monkey business.

(MONKEYS SCREECHING AND CHATTERING)

(NORMAL ACCENT)
Ooh, ooh! I sounded British!

(CHUCKLES)

Meh. Oh, that was really good.

Meh. Meh. (LAUGHS)
That was a great...

- Whatcha doing there, mate?
- Practicing.

Today is my first
day on the phone.

Oh, boy. I'm gonna be so meh.

What are you gonna do?

Ah, me and the boys are gonna

Here's my sauce now.

Why are you laughing, freak?

(DERISIVE LAUGHING)

GENE: Now, unlike me,
my parents are total pros.

Gene, please tell me
you weren't laughing just now.

In public.

Uh...

Oh, he was.
I remember.

Let's go somewhere more private.

I have some bad news, Gene.

And I'm afraid you'll have
the wrong reaction.

Okay. What's the wrong reaction?

Anything other than "meh. "

Mmm.

Come on. I don't want to be late.

I'm not letting you
go to work today.

- Wait, what?
- You're just not ready, son.

Come on! Working in the cube is
an emoji's whole purpose in life.

Everybody my age is working
on the phone except for me.

- Oh, sweetie, that's not true.
- (TOILET FLUSHING)

Aah!

Yeah! I'm gonna work on
the phone, and I'm only 10.

That's because I believe in you.

Should we wash our hands?

(BOTH LAUGHING)

POOP: No, no, no.

POOP AND POOP JR.: We're number two!
We're number two! We're number two!

See?

I... I know I'm different, okay?

But when I need to,
I can be meh.

I just...

I want to be a working emoji,
you know, like...

Like everybody else,
and then...

Then I would finally
fit in, you know?

Oh, you fit in, honey.

No, I don't, Mom.

I never have.

But I can change all that if you'd
just let me. Just give me a chance.

But what if you get sent out on the phone,
making the wrong face?

No, Dad, I'll make the right face.

Look.

Meh...

You're so handsome
when you make that face.

I think he's ready, Mel.

Meh.

Come on, Dad.

Let me prove it to you.

If you really think
you're ready.

I am! Yes! Yes.
I promise, I won't let you down.

Stop.

(GIGGLES) Oh!

Oh, it's really her.

(CHUCKLES) Hi. Hi.

Don't be nervous. I won't bite.
Hi. I'm Smiler. (GIGGLING)

Uh-oh, don't touch me.

- Hi!
- Okay.

I mean, hey.

As you know, I'm Smiler.

I am the system supervisor here

because I was the original emoji.

(GIGGLES)

(EXCITED GASPING)

Here's how it works.

It's nothing fancy.

Wait a minute.
It's really fancy!

(EMOJIS GASPING)

(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)

You each have your own
cube on the emoji bar.

If Alex chooses you,

should you be so lucky,
your cube will light up.

Oh.

It's showtime.

SMILER: The scanner will scan you,

and that scan will get sent
right up to Alex's text box.

And let me tell you, guys, (CHUCKLES)

there is nothing like getting
scanned for the first time.

You're gonna love it. Really.

- (WHISPERS) Wow.
- Now, over here is the favorites section

where you'll find all the
most popular emojis.

And, of course, you'll find
my cube here. (LAUGHS)

Whew.

You are smooth.

Just doing my duty.

- (LAUGHS)
- What? What did I say?

Rocket looking to party. (WHOOPS)

Come on, tell me you aren't
just a little bit tempted.

Steven, for the last time,

- I don't want to buy a time-share.
- (LAUGHS)

Come on, man, it's Hi-5.
You know me, I'm a favorite.

Alex hasn't picked you in weeks.

And if he stops picking you,
you're no longer a favorite.

It's got to be some sort of mistake.

I mean, look at me, I'm an attractive hand
giving a high five.

- Oh. Fist Bump. Come on in.
- Hey.

- Ladies.
- Fist Bump? He's a knucklehead. Literally.

Look at him. I can look like that.

- (KNUCKLES CRACKING)
- Aah! Ow! Cramp. Huge mistake.

(GRUNTING)

Help. Help me.
Help up the hand.

- (GRUNTS) There you go.
- Thanks, mate.

Hey, little Meh, how about
you create a distraction,

and then I'll just
slip under the rope?

- Uh-oh. Is someone lost?
- (HI-5 SIGHS)

Smiler, hi.
Just leaving.

Yeah, you know, just killing time

before I go back to
my cube in the far corner

where Alex can't
even see me anymore!

You may not be
a favorite anymore,

but you will always have
a place in the cube.

Yeah, in the nosebleeds.

Uh, I'm standing right here.
Words hurt.

The most important thing I can
tell you is to just be yourself.

(MOCKING GIBBERISH) Blah.

I was made to be happy,
so I am always smiling. (LAUGHS)

REGGIE: (OVER SPEAKERS) Places, please.
Emojis to your cubes.

Attention. We've got incoming.

Got to be meh. Got to be meh.

Oh, my gosh, my own cube.

I can't believe it. Oh, oh.
I could put a plant over here.

And over here could go
an inspirational calendar.

Okay. Got to be meh.
Got to be meh.

MARY: Look at our son down there.

I'm just beaming

with pride.

You don't think he'll actually
get picked, do you?

Hie-ro-gly-phics.

Hieroglyphics was an ancient
language of picture forms.

Does that remind
anyone of anything?

Hello? A language of pictures.
Anyone?

(SIGHS) Early hieroglyphs
date back as far as 3,300...

(SOFTLY) I got to reply to Addie's text.

- What should I write?
- Nothing.

- Nothing?
- Words aren't cool.

(GASPS)

Okay. Be cool. Be cool.

(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)

All right, Alex is not sure
how he wants to play this.

Oh, I would really
love it to be me.

Beam me up! Beam me up!

I need Thumbs Up on standby.

Oh, yeah! Thumbs Up is going in!

(PANTING AND GRUNTING)

REGGIE: Wait! Alex is changing his mind.

He's moving.

(GASPS)

Okay. Looks like it's gonna be Meh.

I'm so nervous, I could almost shrug.

We are go for Meh.

Initiating scan.

Okay. You can do this.

- (SCREAMS) I can't do this! I can't do it!
- What is this?

- (SCREAMS)
- Stop the scan!

I can't! It's too late!

(PANICKED GASPING) Meh, meh, meh, meh.
My goodness, I'm freaking out!

- What's he doing?
- He's making the wrong face!

Good for him! Little... Wait, what?

- Be meh! Be meh! Be meh!

Oh!

POOP: Oh, the humanity.

(STRAINING) Medic.

(COUGHING)

Sorry, everybody.
That was not what I meant to do.

(CHUCKLES) I kinda...

I kinda panicked.

Are you even a Meh at all?

- Uh, who? Me?
- Course he is.

He's my spitting image.

If you have expressions other than meh,

what you are is a malfunction.

(CHUCKLES AND SIGHS)

(EMOJIS MURMURING)

Malfunction?

No! I can be meh.
Just give me one more chance.

Oh, that's not gonna happen.

what to do with you!

EMOJI 2: What would Alex think?

EMOJI 3: That's the guy.
EMOJI 4: What do his parents think?

(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

I just wanted to be useful, you know?
Fit in.

Now everybody thinks
I'm a malfunction.

(SCOFFS) I am a malfunction.

Even if you are a malfunction, Gene,

your mom and dad still love ya.

I knew you weren't ready.

Let's get you out of
here and take you home.

One day, all this will blow over,

and everyone will almost forget
about what you did.

Until then,

you should probably stay
locked up in the apartment.

Wait. You want to hide me away?

You're embarrassed of me.

It's for your own safety.

We're trying to protect you, son.

Gene? Where are you going?

I'm not gonna run away from this.

I'm an emoji, and even though
I'm not sure exactly which one,

I've got to have some sort of purpose here.

- I know it.
- (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)

Gene, no.

Sweetie, please.

Oh, boy.

EMOJI 1: A malfunction...
EMOJI 2: Order! Order!

- (GAVEL BANGING)
- The motion is carried.

(GASPS)

- So, how'd it go, Gavel?
- Hmm.

Hey, Light Bulb,
tell me what's going on in there.

(GASPS) What? Poop, what is it?

Tell me, turd. Tell me true. What happened?

I know it was an accident.
We all have accidents.

You're so soft, Poop.

Not too soft, I hope.

- SMILER: Gene!
- (SHRIEKS)

We were just gonna come looking for you.

Why don't you come inside the boardroom,
and we can have a teeny, weeny chat.

(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)

(CHUCKLES)

Um, I came up here to defend myself,
but you seem pretty happy.

So, good news?

(LAUGHS) Right. I'm always happy.

Oh, right. Hashtag truth. (CHUCKLES)

SMILER: Well, the only thing
that could ever make me unhappy

is if one of our emoji team made a mistake,

which caused Alex
to lose faith in the phone.

- Oh.
- Ooh.

And then our whole world gets wiped out.

(LAUGHS)

Smiler, I double-pinky-swear promise to you

that I will never, ever
make a mistake in the cube again.

Oh, we know you won't, Gene. (LAUGHS)

We know you won't.

(CHUCKLES) You know,
the first time you said it,

it sounded genuine,
but then you repeated it,

and then, that was weird.

- (GASPS)
- That's because we're setting you up

with our best Anti-Virus Bots.

(WHIRRING)

So, they'll like, uh...
They'll just... They're gonna fix me?

Actually, delete you. But yes!

- Wait, what?
- If you get deleted,

(MUFFLED) you don't have to worry about

what your purpose is or the future

or why you're such a malfunction.

'Cause you're deleted, right?

All right, good talk.

- Bots! (LAUGHS)

Do you have any idea what it's like
to be living large, hashtag blessed,

the favorite of the favorites, and
then demoted to this pit of despair?

Here, will you hit my calluses for me?

At least you're a working emoji.

That's all I ever wanted.

Well, if that's all it'll take

for you to be satisfied, then just
find a hacker and get reprogrammed.

It's not that complicated.

Where would I find a hacker?

In the Piracy app. Duh.

Ah, who took my clear nail polish?

- Ugh.
- Piracy app?

To get there, I mean,
I'd have to leave Textopolis.

So? I've done it.
Would you be a brother?

One of the Princess emojis
left the phone altogether.

Now she lives on the cloud.

Mmm. Oh, that is good.

I'm sure the hacker that helped her
do that could easily reprogram you.

- The name's Jailbreak.
- Jailbreak?

That's great! Reprogrammed.

I just need to be reprogrammed,

and then, I can finally be
the Meh I was meh to be.

Help me find that hacker, Hi-5.
Will you? Please?

Maybe this hacker could help you, too.

Like rewrite some code,
get you into the favorites section.

(GASPS) Wait a minute.

- (SNAPS FINGERS)

Did that cloud taste sweet to you? Ow!

Ow!

- Sweet motherboard!
- Where am I?

(ANNOUNCER READING)

(GRUNTING)

- Already on it!

Hold tight, Gene.

(BOTH GRUNTING)

(GRUNTS)

This feels very odd, and it smells.

I mean, it smells good, it smells
delicious, but I still don't like it.

The game obviously
thinks you're a candy,

even though you're weirdly
misshapen, you know?

What are we gonna do?

Stay very still.

Don't worry. We've got your back.
Right, Hi-5?

- (LICKING NOISILY) Ow!
- Hey, Fingers! You want to focus?

For your information, I happen
to have a sugar addiction,

- and it's a very serious...
- Listen, Finger Head!

We have to get Gene out of the
game without blowing him up.

- (GULPS)
- I don't want to blow up.

We have to match up the candies,
so that Gene will drop to the bottom.

And we can't match him
with any yellows, or else...

Aah! Don't do that.
Please don't do that.

Watch.

- You got it?
- Match three in a row.

Don't blow Gene up. Got it.

And we have to be very careful.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Careful.
(WHOOPS) Candy!

- Watch it!
- HI-5: Hey! Whoa!

GENE: No! No, no, no! Slow down.

Not the yellows!
Not the yellows.

- I said careful!
- (HI-5 YELLS)

My mom just joined Facebook.
Can you believe she wanted to friend me?

Hey, Addie, I was just
wondering if you are...

- CANDY CRUSH ANNOUNCER: Tasty.
- What?

- CANDY CRUSH ANNOUNCER: Delicious.
- Um... Excuse me?

- CANDY CRUSH ANNOUNCER: Sweet.
- Uh...

- NIKKI: Hey, Addie!
- Oh, hi, Nikki.

- No!
- See you later, Alex.

- CANDY CRUSH ANNOUNCER: Sugar Crush.
- Aah!

So over this.

(SPEED DIALING)

WOMAN: Wireless Wireless.
How may I help you?

I'd like to make an appointment.

It's like this phone is
playing games with me.

Whoa! Whoa!

Hey, what does this do?

(SHRIEKS) Whoa!

(GASPS) Oh, no!

Get me out of here!

(JAILBREAK PANTING)

(STRAINING)

Ow, ow, ow!

- HI-5: Oh, suck it in!
- No! Ow! Stop it! Stop, stop! Ow, ow!

- It's not working.
- Well, there's one option left.

We line you up with the yellows.

But you said not to do that.

Special candies get
transported to that jar.

The game might think
you're a special candy.

And what if it doesn't think
I'm a special candy?

Well...

(GASPS AND SHOUTS)

(YELLING)

(BOTH SCREAMING)

- GENE: Jailbreak, hello? Hello, Jailbreak?
- Oh. Uh, sorry.

What if it doesn't think
I'm a special candy?

Oh, I'm not too worried about it.

Okay, just do it.

(RUMBLING)

(BEEPING)

HI-5: Gene!

Gene?

Hey. Oh. Oh, no!

Gene! You're alive! (KISSES)

You were trying to see if I had
somehow turned into candy, weren't you?

Yes, I was. And you have not.

(QUIET BEEP)

Hey. Looks like something popped up
on Alex's calendar.

Eh, I'm sure it's nothing.

NERD EMOJI: Uh, Alex made an appointment
at the phone store.

(CLAMORING)
(MONKEYS SCREECHING)

Oh, no! Oh!

(CRYING LOUDLY)

SMILER: Calm down, everyone!

Calm down.

Don't worry. Everything is fine.

Maybe Alex just wants
to buy some accessories.

Uh, his appointment
is with technical support.

Well, I'm sure we still have plenty
of time to figure this out. Hmm?

- Uh, his appointment is for tomorrow.
- (GARGLES)

Then maybe it's just
for some routine maintenance.

Uh, actually, it's to erase the phone.

(SMILER GRUNTS QUIETLY)

JAILBREAK: Listen, Gene, I'm about
to become your knight in shining armor.

- You are?
- Oh, yeah.

(SHOUTS) Ow!

JAILBREAK: But first,
we need to get uploaded to the cloud.

That's where we'll find the source code
to reprogram you.

- The cloud?
- (HI-5 WHOOPS)

Isn't that off the phone?

Ding, ding, ding, ding. You got it.

Mmm-hmm. Yeah, the cloud. Off the phone.

(CHEWING NOISILY)

We're in Candy Crush, obvs.

I know a shortcut to Just Dance,

which is right next to Dropbox,

where we can get uploaded to the cloud.

Mmm! Of course.
Just Dance, then boogie over to Dropbox,

catch the link, and zoom.

Hold up. Here's the stinker.

Before they let us into the cloud,
we have to get past this firewall.

(HI-5 AND GENE SHRIEK)

- The firewall uses face identification.
- Yeah, the firewall. Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

Which is really annoying,
because I've already tried to get through.

Guessed wrong once,
and now I'm locked out for life.

HI-5: Locked out for life?

Oh, you're thinking,
'cause I can make different faces,

- the firewall will think I'm different emojis.
- Yeah.

I wanted to say it
'cause it was my idea.

You know, women are always
coming up with stuff

that men are taking credit for.

- You know what... (GRUNTS)
- Well, then let's hit the road.

Hi-5, you coming?

I'm coming! Ugh!

Why do I always think I'm gonna
come around on black licorice?

Aah!

(GASPS) My precious.

JAILBREAK: Hey! Move it!

HI-5: Certain death, here we come.

MEL: Let's try this one.

MARY: YouTube?

(INDISTINCT TALKING OVER SCREENS)
(MUSIC PLAYING)

MEL: Wow.

What a visual treat.

And I don't even need a remote.

That guy is so expressive.

MARY: He reminds me of Gene.

Yeah. Something really wrong with him.

- Mel.
- Our son is a malfunction,

and you should never have
let him go into that cube.

Don't blame me for this, Mel.

I am hopping mad at you.

See?

Mary, I think we're being followed.

But don't overreact.

Uh-oh.

I told you not to overreact.

What are you doing now?

They'll be in there for hours.

BOTS: Aw!

Aw!

- Aw!
- (MEOWING)

Aw!

Aw!

Mary, where are you going?

I think we should go our
separate ways, Mel.

I thought I knew
the Meh that I married,

but maybe I don't.

But, Mary...

JAILBREAK: This tunnel will help us
avoid the Bots.

GENE: Thanks for helping us.
It's really nice of you.

NBD, dude. The truth is,
you're helping me.

Come on, let's move it. Why so slow?

Hi-5, stop. Why are you getting so close?
What's with you? Back off.

Can't stop now.
I'm having a sugar rush!

I'll go around you.
If I stop moving, my heart's gonna explode!

- Coming through, Jailbreak! Look out!
- JAILBREAK: Hey! Watch it, Knuckle Butt!

I can't feel my face. (LAUGHS)

So, Jailbreak,
back there you said I'm helping you.

I've been trying to
get past that firewall for months.

(GIGGLES) Come on, come on! The faster we
get there, the faster I become a favorite!

(GIGGLING)

(WHOOPS) Look at me!

I just want to bounce out of here,
get off the phone, and live on the cloud.

Oh! Whoa.

(SIGHS)

(GIGGLES) Ow!

What just happened?

- (GRUNTING)
- You don't like it here?

There's so many rules here.
What is up with that?

The cloud is supposed to be amazing.

There's so much to see and do. (GRUNTS)

Uh-oh. Sugar crash.

I can't hold on anymore.

Catch me, Gene. Catch me!

And you can be whoever you want.

(HI-5 SCREAMING)

- Thanks.
- You're free! Come on!

(WHOOPS)

(LAUGHS)

Oh, my gosh, my hands are sweating.

- JAILBREAK: You are a hand!
- Whoa, whoa!

Whoa! (WHOOPS)

(ALL WHOOPING)

JAILBREAK: Yeah!

(HI-5 LAUGHING)
(GENE YELLING)

(HI-5 GROANS)

You know, come to think of it,
I don't really remember

there ever being a hacker emoji.

Oh, um, you know, you're taking
up too much of my brain space.

Let's keep the chitchat to a minimum.

- (SIGHS)
- Ooh.

- Someone likes you.
- What are you talking about?

This is just like when Peace Sign
gave me just one finger.

I knew she was in love with me.

- JAILBREAK: Let's go!
- (STOMACH GRUMBLES)

I'm never eating another
piece of candy ever again.

Hi-5, don't do it.

Don't you do it.
It's already been in there once.

Don't do it.

Wow.

- JAILBREAK: Move it!
- Are my fingers getting fat?

I'll tell you what,
this bandage wasn't so tight before.

Okay. We get through this app,
and Dropbox is right on the other side.

We just need to keep it super DL in here.

And no matter what, we can't turn it on.

(LOUD CLICK)
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

OMG, this turned it on!

What? I'm a hand.
It's a big, red button.

(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING IN DISTANCE)

Whoa.

- What's happening?
- No, no, no, no, no!

Welcome to Just Dance!

Follow my moves
and you get to move forward.

Do the wrong moves
and you get an "X."

Three strikes and you're out.

Out? What does she mean by "Out"?

Digital death.

Oh, thanks to you, Fingers.
Now we're gonna have to dance our way out.

Which is all right with me,
'cause I can shake it like Michael.

Or Michael's glove, anyway.

Are you ready to dance?

This is bad, Gene. I can't dance.
I got no groove.

Come on. Everybody can dance.

Not me, okay?
I'm really stiff.

See? I can't... (SIGHS) Don't understand.

GENE: No.
HI-5: Okay. No, no...

- Hey, no, stop, stop.
- Stop, stop. She has to stop.

I see now what you are saying.
Just follow her moves.

Ready to dance in three...

This I can't do.

Hey, wait. Where's Hi-5?

Alex trashed the app.

And Hi-5 right along with it.

Wait, what?
Wait, trashed?

Hi-5 is in the trash?

He wanted to dance.

But I knew it was a bad idea.

- I'm so sorry.
- We got to get him out of there.

Gene, Dropbox is right here.
That's our ticket to the cloud.

And the trash is on
the other side of the phone.

We don't know how many
other Bots are out there.

- I'm sorry.
- No way. We can't go without Hi-5.

I don't care how far away it is.

- Gene.
- That's my friend down there.

I'm not just gonna leave
him to get deleted.

What? What is it?

I've always just thought
you got to look out for number one.

Well, what good is it to be number one
if there aren't any other numbers?

Wow.

Okay.

I'm sorry.
This is my malfunction.

I just... I can't be

This is why I'm going
to get reprogrammed.

Well, it's actually kind of cool.

I know a shortcut.

We can take the music

Let's go give that

he tossed it in the trash.

Hi-5, this is very important.

What is her name?

Her name, yes.
Excellent question.

It was Tina.

Karen.

Marge. Lindsey.

(STAMMERS) Alison.
(SIGHS)

Sarah or Lupita.

I want to say Lupita,

but that doesn't feel right
now I'm saying it out loud.

- (GROANS)
- Jennifer.

JAILBREAK: Got to find that e-mail.
HI-5: Phillipa.

- Sue. Deborah.
- JAILBREAK: I think I can access the trash.

HI-5: Annabelle.

- I got it! Addie!
- HI-5: Yes!

Yes! That's it! Addie!

I knew I'd get there.

"Dear Addie, you and I,
we're like diamonds in the sky.

"You're a shooting star I see,

"a vision of ecstasy.

"Shine bright like a diamond. "

And he used a high five, see?

I guess now we know
why he trashed it.

Ooh. Shade.

Guys, should we try this?

(ELECTRONIC CHIME)

Addie.

Access granted. (ECHOING)

Oh, snap.

This place is amazing.

JAILBREAK: The cloud.

I can't believe it.

HI-5: Whoa.

One little emoji could sure
get lost in a place like this.

I guess we should make you a Meh
before that Bot comes back, huh?

Oh. Oh, so, we're gonna...
We're gonna do that now?

We had a deal.

Right?

Yeah, okay. Right.

I, uh, guess I'll start hacking.

(BEEPING)

HI-5: (LAUGHS) We did it, Gene.

All our dreams are coming true.

I'll be an Alex favorite again,
and you'll be a real Meh.

Oh, yeah!

♪ Pop it with the pinky ♪

Yeah, but this all seems
kind of super-fast now, though.

Doesn't it?

Hi-5, I just didn't expect to be
having these feelings right now.

Well, maybe you should go and
express them while you still can.

So, uh, I've been...
I mean, um...

Ever since we...

Jailbreak, you're the coolest,
most interesting emoji I've ever met.

And after all the
adventures that we had,

I'm just not sure I want
all that to go away,

because my feelings
right now are, like, huge.

I just think that they could be enough
for me to want to stay the way I am.

If it means I could
stay here with you.

Like, forever.

Forever and ever and ever.

Maybe longer than that even.

Like in the fairy tales.

Uh...

(STAMMERS) Like, what is "uh"?
Is that a good "uh"?

Gene, if this is about
you deciding not to be meh,

then I am all about that.

I like you just
the way you are.

But I had a plan.

Right. (SIGHS)

I'm not just some princess, Gene,
waiting for my prince.

I mean, what you said
was beautiful, but...

Gene.

HI-5: (LAUGHS) Whoa.
You're all meh.

The source code worked!

Turns out I didn't need it.

For the first time in my life,
meh is all I feel.

(SHRIEKS)

No! Gene!

Hi. I have an appointment.
I'm a little early.

No problem.
I can take you right now.

- Jailbreak!
- (SCREAMS)

Don't do that!

That freaky huge Bot has got
Gene back inside the phone.

What?

He left looking more meh than
the meh-est meh face I've ever seen.

What did you say to him?

(SIGHS)

It's what I didn't say.

We've got to go get him.

How are we gonna get in there
in time before he gets deleted?

(GROANS) I can't believe I'm doing this.

You tell anyone you saw this,
and I'll crack more than those knuckles.

(GULPS)

(GASPS)

Birds do love princesses!

It's not a myth.

It's not a myth at all!

What happened to
becoming a favorite?

Guess I'd rather have
one real friend.

And let's go get him.

I can't wait to see the
look on Gene's face!

SMILER: Look at that expression.

Is that for realizing you've
put all of Textopolis at risk,

causing Alex
to question our reliability?

Hmm?

Hey, that's going
too far, even for me.

If we can delete this malfunction
before his appointment,

they'll discover there's
nothing wrong with the phone.

Any last words?

Meh.

Well, it's too late for that.

- Delete him!
- MEL: Wait.

(EMOJIS GASPING AND MURMURING)

You delete Gene,
you'll have to delete me, too.

- What?
- I have the same malfunction Gene does.

(EMOJIS GASP)

(GASPS) Dad?

Oh, gosh, I don't know what to do.

Yes, I do.

Bot!

- No!
- Ah.

Sorry, Mrs. Meh.

(SOFT GRUNTING AND SIGHS)

Whoa. (GRUNTS)

(POWERING UP)

Oh, I did not see that one coming.

Smiler, I think you might be making
too much stink out of all this.

Oh, really?
How about you're next?

- (EMOJIS GASPING)
- Huh?

I was wrong, Gene.

I should've believed in you all along.

Aw, what a touching
daddy-son reunion moment.

It reminds me of the time
I deleted you both.

Oh, wait. That's this time!

Delete the two malfunctions!

(GRUNTS)

BOTH: No.

How's that for an...

(EMOJIS GROANING)

(HI-5 GROANS)

(BEEPING)

Oh, great.

(SHOUTING)

(BOT BELLOWING)

(YELLS)

(GRUNTS)

I can't reach!

(GASPING)

(GROANS)

(SCREAMS)

(POWERING DOWN)

Oh, no! What did you
do to my beautiful...

(GROANS) Oh, my tooth.

(EMOJIS GASP)

Hand, button.

Jailbreak?

Oh, Gene.

You really are a Meh.

What happened to looking out
for number one?

Being number one doesn't matter
if there aren't any other numbers.

(ALARM BLARING)

PIZZA: Alex's appointment!

He's deleting the phone!

No, no, no!

Show me Alex.

EMPLOYEE: Are you sure you want
to delete everything?

Do it.

(EMOJIS GASPING)

- (SCREAMING)
- Red alert! Red alert!

Alex, no!

CANDY CRUSH ANNOUNCER: Game over.

(KITTEN YOWLS)

Fellas, I'm afraid
this is last call.

Dude, Addie's here.
You should go over.

(PHONE BEEPING)
(GIGGLES)

(BOTH GIGGLING)

Every time I try, I screw it up.

I don't know how to tell her how I feel.

If we help Alex connect to Addie,
maybe he won't delete us.

I might be able to bypass the wipe
and get a text through to him.

But we'll only have time to send one.

Maybe I should go.

He has love in his eyes.

Send me. Alex looks nervous, too.

He's more shy than nervous.

Stop!

It's Gene.

He's all of those things.

SMILER: An emoji should only be one thing.

- Oh, really?
- (EMOJIS GASPING)

The Princess!

FEMALE EMOTICON: Linda!

Not now, Mom!

Gene, you got this.

That's not me anymore.

But I have to try.

- (RUMBLING)
- It's starting!

No, it's ending!

(EMOJIS CLAMORING)

(ALL SCREAMING)

- Almost in?
- I'm working on it.

Mom? Dad?

No.

I'm in.

Last time I was in this cube,
I screwed everything up.

Gene, why do you think I came back?

It's because of you.

Me?

It's all inside of you, Gene.

Just try to bring it back.

And do you.

(HI-5 SCREAMS)
(GASPS)

- Hi-5!
- I don't want to wave good-bye.

It's now or never, Gene.

(INAUDIBLE)

Jailbreak, now!

(BEEPS)

Whoa!

Check out this emoji.

(PHONE VIBRATES)

(GIGGLES) No way.

(BOTH GIGGLE)

Mmm?

(SIGHS)

Hey, I got your text.

That's one super-cool emoji.

I know, right?

A lot of feelings in one.
I get it.

I like that you're one of those guys
who can actually express his feelings.

Yeah. (NERVOUS CHUCKLE) That's me.

- So, do you think you'd want to...
- Yes.

I'd love to go to the dance with you.

Hey, excuse me.

Ah!

We made it!

Oh, I could've lost you, Peter Pinkie.
(KISSES)

Or you, Reggie Ring Finger.

Even you, Tiberius Thumb.

Change your mind?

Yeah, maybe it's weird, but...

I'm gonna hold on to it.

(EMOJIS CHEERING)

Gene, you did it!

You saved us all!

(EMOJIS APPLAUDING)

EMOJIS: Aw.

Oh, Mel.

Gene! Gene!

ALL: (CHANTING) Gene! Gene! Gene!

Gene. Gene. Gene.

Gene! Gene! Gene! Gene!

Gene! Gene! Gene!
Gene! Gene! Gene!

HI-5: They love us! And Hi-5!

And Hi-5! And Hi-5! And Hi-5!

They love both of us!
